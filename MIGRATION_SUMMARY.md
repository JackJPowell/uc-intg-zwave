# Migration Summary: Lutron Caseta to Z-Wave Integration

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the Lutron Caseta integration to a Z-Wave integration.

## Overview

The integration has been successfully converted from controlling Lutron Caseta hubs to controlling Z-Wave devices via Z-Wave JS Server. The overall structure and architecture remain the same, with key changes to the communication layer and device handling.

## Key Changes

### 1. Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)
- **Changed:** `pylutron-caseta` → `zwave-js-server-python==0.67.1`
- **Added:** `aiohttp` (required by zwave-js-server-python)
- **Kept:** `ucapi==0.3.1` (Unfolded Circle API)

### 2. Constants (`const.py`)
- Renamed `LutronLightInfo` → `ZWaveLightInfo`
  - Added `node_id: int` field
  - Added `brightness: int` field
- Renamed `LutronCoverInfo` → `ZWaveCoverInfo`
  - Added `node_id: int` field
- Renamed `LutronSceneInfo` → `ZWaveSceneInfo`

### 3. Configuration (`config.py`)
- Renamed `LutronConfig` → `ZWaveConfig`
- Updated documentation references from "Lutron device" to "Z-Wave controller"
- Changed `address` field documentation from "IP Address" to "WebSocket URL"
- Updated all type hints and import statements

### 4. Bridge Communication (`bridge.py`)
**Major architectural changes:**

- **Connection:**
  - Replaced `pylutron_caseta.smartbridge.Smartbridge` with `ZWaveClient`
  - Changed from TLS certificate-based connection to WebSocket connection
  - Removed certificate file handling code
  
- **Event Handling:**
  - Added `_on_value_updated()` and `_on_node_status_changed()` methods
  - Implemented Z-Wave event handler registration
  - Updated light state tracking to use node_id instead of device_id

- **Device Control:**
  - `turn_on_light()`: Now uses Z-Wave node_id and converts brightness (0-255 to 0-100)
  - `turn_off_light()`: Simplified to use node_id
  - `toggle_light()`: Updated to use node state tracking
  
- **Device Discovery:**
  - `get_lights()`: Now queries Z-Wave network for switch/dimmer devices
  - Filters devices by type (switch, dimmer, multilevel)
  - `get_scenes()`: Returns empty list (Z-Wave scenes to be implemented)

### 5. Light Entity (`light.py`)
- Renamed `LutronLight` → `ZWaveLight`
- Updated device type detection logic
  - Removed Lutron-specific "claro" check
  - Added Z-Wave device type checking (switch vs multilevel)
- Updated brightness handling to use 0-255 scale (vs 0-100 for Lutron)
- Changed entity_id to use node_id instead of device_id

### 6. Button Entity (`button.py`)
- Renamed `LutronButton` → `ZWaveButton`
- Updated all references from Lutron to Z-Wave
- Scene activation remains placeholder (to be implemented)

### 7. Driver (`driver.py`)
- Updated all imports: `LutronConfig` → `ZWaveConfig`, `LutronLight` → `ZWaveLight`, `LutronButton` → `ZWaveButton`
- Updated log messages and documentation
- Changed terminology from "Lutron device" to "Z-Wave controller"

### 8. Setup Process (`setup.py`)
**Significant changes:**

- **Pairing:**
  - Removed Lutron pairing process (async_pair, certificate generation)
  - Z-Wave JS Server doesn't require pairing

- **Discovery:**
  - Changed from Zeroconf mDNS discovery to manual configuration
  - Updated UI text to request WebSocket URL instead of IP address
  - Default input changed from IP to "ws://"

- **Connection:**
  - Replaced Lutron Smartbridge connection with ZWaveClient
  - Changed validation from IP address to WebSocket URL format
  - Updated device enumeration to use Z-Wave device types

- **Configuration:**
  - Controller identifier now derived from WebSocket URL
  - Changed device model to "Z-Wave JS Server"
  - Removed certificate file handling

### 9. Discovery (`discover.py`)
- Renamed `ZeroconfService` → `ZWaveServer`
- Renamed `ZeroconfScanner` → `ZWaveDiscovery`
- Updated service type from `_lutron._tcp.local.` to `_zwave-js-server._tcp.local.`
- Updated documentation for Z-Wave JS Server

### 10. Driver Metadata (`driver.json`)
- Changed `driver_id` from "lutron_driver" to "zwave_driver"
- Updated version to "0.1.0"
- Changed name from "Lutron Caseta" to "Z-Wave"
- Updated all descriptions and documentation
- Changed home_page URL
- Updated release_date

### 11. Documentation (`README.md`)
- Updated title and badges
- Changed feature descriptions
- Added Z-Wave JS Server prerequisite
- Updated installation instructions
- Changed terminology throughout

## New File: `zwave_client.py`

This file provides the Z-Wave JS Server client interface and was included as part of the migration. It provides:
- Connection management to Z-Wave JS Server
- Device discovery and information
- Real-time event monitoring
- Device control commands (turn_on, turn_off, set_dimmer_level)
- Event handler registration

## Architecture Differences

### Lutron Caseta
- Uses TLS certificates for authentication
- Direct connection to Lutron bridge
- Proprietary protocol
- Requires pairing process

### Z-Wave JS Server
- Uses WebSocket connection
- Connects to Z-Wave JS Server (which talks to Z-Wave network)
- Standard WebSocket protocol
- No pairing required (Z-Wave pairing handled separately by Z-Wave JS)

## What Still Needs Implementation

1. **Z-Wave Scenes:** Currently returns empty list, needs implementation
2. **Cover Entities:** Code structure exists but needs Z-Wave-specific implementation
3. **Additional Device Types:** Sensors, locks, thermostats, etc.
4. **Error Handling:** More robust error handling for Z-Wave-specific scenarios
5. **Device State Synchronization:** Enhanced real-time state updates
6. **Node Management:** Add/remove nodes, node configuration

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test connection to Z-Wave JS Server
2. Verify light discovery and control
3. Test brightness adjustment for dimmers
4. Verify on/off for binary switches
5. Test reconnection handling
6. Verify entity state updates

## Notes

- The overall integration structure remains intact
- All UC API interactions remain the same
- The main changes are in the device communication layer
- Error handling and logging patterns were preserved
